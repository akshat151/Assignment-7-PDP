Code Review of Provider's Code

Design Critique:

The provider's code has a fairly robust overall design. The modularity of the codebase makes it easy to add new features. However, the existing design and interfaces between different components of the system could be made more flexible to allow for interface extension without violating the Open-close solid design principles, which are crucial for supporting future changes in the existing code which adheres to the SOLID design principles.


Implementation Critique:

We had to request changes from our code providers to support the bmp image file format required for Assignment 5. After the changes were made, we received an updated code base that supported IME operations through both the command line and gui for the .bmp image file formats. We needed the change in their existing code base to perform image mosaicking operation for Assignment 7 in all the supported image file formats (png, bmp, ppm, jpeg).

Furthermore, the Dithering operation is not implemented correctly, as the output image after the dithering operation does not look correct. Also, the dithering code is not modularized, and the entire code logic is written inside one single method, making the method length longer than necessary.

Overall, the code implementation is generally good, with some areas for improvement as mentioned above.


Documentation Critique:

The codebase is reasonably well-documented.


Design/Code Strengths:

The codebase has a number of strengths, such as proper error handling, effective use of abstraction where necessary, and a modular design that makes it easy to add new features. Additionally, the tests written by the providers of our code were quite extensive and easy to understand and extend.

Design/Code Limitations and Suggestions on How to Address Them:

There are some limitations in the codebase design that need to be addressed. For example, instead of using hard-coded strings everywhere in the code implementation, there should be a separate constants file to store all the hard-coded strings. This separation of hard-coded strings into a constants file ensures that the same hard-coded strings can be used throughout the code without having to write them repeatedly, and allows us to change the text inside the Constants file whenever required without making changes to the existing codebase.

Furthermore, the GUI is not resizable, and the current JFrame does not implement image horizontal scrollability correctly, limiting visualization of large-sized image files (images larger than the image panel width and height). 

Also, the interfaces between different components of the system could also be made more flexible to allow for greater customization by the users. Currently, the ImageInterface is tightly coupled with the entire codebase, and any attempts to extend the existing interface to support newer operations would require changes to the entire existing codebase, which would violate the Open-close solid design principles.
In short, the ImageInterface and the rest of the code should not be tightly coupled with each other.

Summary :
In summary, the provider's codebase is robust, but there is room for improvement in areas such as interface flexibility and GUI implementation. Addressing these issues will make the code easier to use and customize, leading to a better user experience. Overall, the codebase is a solid foundation for further development, and with some modifications and improvements, it could become even more effective and efficient.
